# Synthetic Data Generation Configuration

# Data dimensions
n_units: 10000
n_time_periods: 50
n_covariates: 10

# Treatment configuration
n_treatments: 3  # Number of non-control treatments (0=control, 1,2,3=treatments)
treatment_probabilities: [0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]  # Target probabilities for [control, t1, t2, t3]
# Note: Actual probabilities will vary due to covariate-dependent assignment (confounding)
# Treatment assignment depends on X_0, X_1, X_2 via multinomial logit model

# Outcome generation
noise_std: 1.0
base_outcome_range: [10, 50]  # Range for baseline outcome

# Treatment effects (heterogeneous by covariates)
treatment_effects:
  # Effect of treatment 1 vs control
  treatment_1:
    base_effect: 5.0
    heterogeneity_strength: 2.0  # How much effect varies by covariates
    interaction_covariates: [0, 1, 2]  # Which covariates interact with treatment
  
  # Effect of treatment 2 vs control
  treatment_2:
    base_effect: 8.0
    heterogeneity_strength: 3.0
    interaction_covariates: [1, 2, 3]
  
  # Effect of treatment 3 vs control
